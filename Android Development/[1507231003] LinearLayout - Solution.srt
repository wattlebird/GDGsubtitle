1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,040
If you open up the link to the XML visualizer, that we provided

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,390
you in the instructor notes, then this is what it would look like.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,410
We have a linear layout with a text view that says Guest List and

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,570
another text view that says Kunal.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,020
The first task was to add more text views to create the guest list.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,780
So let's copy and paste this XML element.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,090
Cool, let's add some other people besides Kunal.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,710
Let's add Kagure and also Lyla.

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,570
Awesome.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,900
So now Kagure and Lyla show up under Kunal's name.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,400
We can also change any of the existing text use.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,220
We change to the VIP list.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,120
The second task was to change the orientation attribute to be horizontal.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,770
This immediately changes all the text views to appear side by side

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:45,775
instead of one on top of the other.
