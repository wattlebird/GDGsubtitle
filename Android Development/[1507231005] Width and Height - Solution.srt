In a previous video, I showed you what happens when you set match parent for

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,270
the width of each of these child views.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,860
The text view ends up extending across the full width of the parent.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,650
There's no right or wrong solutions for how you experimented with the code.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,570
Here's another thing you could've tried.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,350
If you set the linear layout to have an orientation of horizontal,

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,510
then the views will be displayed in a horizontal row.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,530
If you set match parent for the width of the VIP list,

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,750
then it unfortunately knocks off the other views off the screen.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,140
If you set match parent for the height of the text you, then you see that

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,700
the VIP list text view is now the full height of the parent linear layout.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,420
The same can be done for the other children views, or

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,730
you can set a fixed height.

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,580
In the previous video, we showed you what happens when you set matched parent

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,570
for the width of each of these child text views.

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,050
The text view extends to the full width of the parent linear layout.

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,750
If you set a fixed height on the TextView, like 300 DP,

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,390
then this is what it will look like on the device.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:00,395
There's no right or wrong answers for what you tried out.
