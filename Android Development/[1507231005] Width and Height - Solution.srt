00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,560
在前一个视频里 我已经向你演示了当设置每个子元素的宽度为match_parent的时候
In a previous video, I showed you what happens when you set match parent for

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,270
会发生什么
the width of each of these child views.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,860
TextView的宽度会扩展至父元素的宽度
The text view ends up extending across the full width of the parent.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,650
这道题没有标准答案
There's no right or wrong solutions for how you experimented with the code.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,570
这也可能是另一种你曾经的尝试
Here's another thing you could've tried.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,350
如果你把线性布局改成水平
If you set the linear layout to have an orientation of horizontal,

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,510
所有的View就会在一个水平线上呈现
then the views will be displayed in a horizontal row.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,530
如果你对Vip名单的宽度设置为match_parent
If you set match parent for the width of the VIP list,

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,750
很不巧 它就会把所有其他的View推出屏幕
then it unfortunately knocks off the other views off the screen.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,140
如果你把高度设置为match_parent 你就会发现
If you set match parent for the height of the text you, then you see that

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,700
VIP列表的TextView会和其父元素一样高
the VIP list text view is now the full height of the parent linear layout.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,420
同样地 这也可以适用于其他子元素的View
The same can be done for the other children views, or

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,730
或者你可以设定一个固定高度
you can set a fixed height.

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,580
在先前的视频里 我们向你展示了当设置子元素的宽度
In the previous video, we showed you what happens when you set matched parent

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,570
为match_parent时的境况
for the width of each of these child text views.

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,050
TextView和作为线性布局的父元素一样宽
The text view extends to the full width of the parent linear layout.

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,750
如果你为TextView设定一个固定的高度 如300dp
If you set a fixed height on the TextView, like 300 DP,

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,390
那么它在设备上就像这样
then this is what it will look like on the device.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:00,395
没有标准答案 只要你试过就可以了
There's no right or wrong answers for what you tried out.
