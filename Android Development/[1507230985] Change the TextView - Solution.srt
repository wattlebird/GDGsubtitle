1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,950
All right, so first we load up the webpage that was linked

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,860
in the instructor notes.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,890
We see that it's populated already with some code for

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,060
the Happy Birthday TextView.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,350
And then on the right, we see the preview and the device.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,420
To change the text that appears here,

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,285
we need to change the value of the attribute called Android:text.

8
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,335
So in between the quotes here we can change the message.

9
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:28,425
Can change it to, hm, Happy Birthday to my pet hamster!

10
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:34,060
Then on the device, we can see that the text has now been updated, woohoo!

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,705
To change the size of the view, we can modify the width and

12
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:37,983
height attribute values.

13
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:41,459
The in between quotations, we can delete that and

14
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:44,206
change it to something like 250dp.

15
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:48,003
And then for the height we can change it to like 450dp.

16
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:52,065
And now, we see that the text view with the gray background is now a lot bigger.

17
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:52,879
Cool.

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,460
So, the last part of the quiz was to try to create an error.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,820
So, if I delete the forward slash and the angle bracket, then,

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,350
I get a bunch of errors that show up on the bottom, here.

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,060
Also, the device greys out,

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,910
because there's no valid preview to show on the device anymore.

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,780
These errors can help you fix your code, and since we know what

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,460
we need to do to fix it, we can just hit Ctrl+Z to undo the changes we made.

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,530
The undo shortcut is really useful to use, so it's Cmd+Z on a Mac,

26
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,860
or Ctrl+Z on a Windows.

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,030
We can create other errors as well, such as deleting a quotation mark and

28
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,476
we see the error down here.

29
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:34,150
We can hit undo to make it come back.

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,510
Or we can change darker grey to parker grey,

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,480
which apparently Android doesn't recognize, unfortunately.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:40,485
So we can just switch it back.
