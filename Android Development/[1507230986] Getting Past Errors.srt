1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,430
我们让你在上一个问题中制造一个错误并修正它的原因
The reason why we asked you the last question about creating an error and

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,570
是这对于开发者来说是一个重要技能
fixing the error is because an important skill of developers

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,330
那就是修正错误
is to be able to get past errors.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,255
没有一个开发者能够在第一次就写出完美无缺的代码
There's no developer who writes code perfectly the first time.

5
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:15,875
仔细想一想
If you think about it,

6
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:20,765
所有的 Google 搜索服务产品都不是在一天里写成的
the whole Google search product was not written in one day perfectly.

7
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:25,765
它需要需多年的反复修改 以前如此 以后仍然如此
It was a lot of iteration over many years, and it continues to be.

8
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:30,203
因此 无论你是一个新手开发者或有经验的开发者
So, regardless of whether you're a new developer or you're an experienced

9
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:34,794
完成目标并不是一帆风顺的
developer, in order to get to the end goal, it's not exactly a straight path.

10
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:39,087
你会在途中遇到各种各样的障碍 你得在其中展示出创造性
You'll run into obstacles along the way, and you have to be really creative in

11
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:43,650
以克服这些困难
terms of trying to come up with other solutions to go around that obstacle.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,880
一旦你克服了 你会遇到另外的障碍 如此这般
So once you get around it, then you'll run into another obstacle and so on.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,860
你会一直思索解决问题
And you just always want to keep thinking of ways to get

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,640
的方法
around that obstacle.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,680
最终 你找到了一条到达目标的路径
And eventually, after a lot of work, you finally find the path to the goal, and

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,400
尽管历经坎坷 这仍然是物超所值的
even though it was super challenging, it was totally worth it in the end because

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,060
你会信心百倍并为你完成的工作而自豪
you feel empowered and confident and just really proud of your work.

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,700
真正优秀的开发者知道如何从错误中学习
So the really good developers know how to rebound from an error and

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,220
并继续他们的工作
continue with their work.

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,330
这些是一些用于调试、解决错误的
So here are some habits and

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,810
习惯和策略
strategies that they use to debug, or fix, their errors.

22
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,920
首先阅读错误信息
First they read the error message.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,770
当你在 Google Docs 中写文档时
When you're writing a document in Google Docs, for example,

24
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,280
如果有拼写错误 它会用红色下划线提示
if there's any misspellings, then it will tell you with a red underline.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,250
相似地 在Android Studio里 如果你写错了XML
Similarly in Android Studio, if you have typed XML incorrectly, then

26
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,810
会有一条红色下划波浪线 或者错误会被标红
it will have a red, squiggly underline, or it will be highlighted in red.

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,866
而且在这边的边栏
Also, in this bar on the side here,

28
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:44,169
如果你放在红色柱条上它会给你显示信息
it will show you the message if you hover over the red bar.

29
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:48,871
在我们的XML可视化器里面 也会有有帮助的错误信息
But in our XML Visualizer, there's also helpful error messages.

30
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:52,996
因此当我们制造一个错误的时候 比如说移除这个引号
So if I create an error, like removing this quotation mark, it will tell me

31
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:57,350
它会告诉我引号没有配对 我需要修正
that there's an uneven number of quotes and that I need to fix it.

32
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,630
有时 它也会告诉你出现问题所在的行
Sometimes, it also tells you the line number that the problem is on.

33
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,320
行号在左手边
The line numbers are on the left hand side here.

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,320
在第六行我们知道有一个问题
So, on line six, we know that there's a problem.

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,370
这有助于我们精确定位错误所在位置而非通读全部代码
This helps narrow down the problem space instead of having to read through all

36
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,210
才得以搞清楚错误
your code and trying to figure out what the problem is.

37
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,720
如果你仍然不知道错误信息
If you still don't understand the error message, try to

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,780
试图找出你知道意思的词和你不知道意思的词
identify words that you do understand and the words that you don't understand.

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,170
你可以 Google 你不知道意思的词
You can always Google search for the words that you don't understand, or you

40
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,440
或者直接把错误信息贴在 google 里搜
can just copy the whole error message and paste that into a Google search.

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,150
另一个技巧就是使用可以正常运行的样例代码
The other technique is to use working code samples and

42
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,970
并与你的代码比较 看看哪里有问题
compare it to what you have to try to figure out what went wrong.

43
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,310
我们已经在先前几个视频中给你了一些代码
We've already given you some code to look at in the last few videos, and

44
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,458
还有一个好的资源是常见Android View速查表
another good resource is the Common Android Views cheat sheet that

45
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,960
我们会把它给你
we'll provide you.

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,320
这里 我们会看到不同的 view 的名字和代码片段
Here, we see the names of different views, and we also have code snippets as

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,470
还有它们在设备上的预览
well as a preview of what they would look like on the device.

48
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,120
You can always compare your code to what we have here and

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,170
see if there's any differences.

50
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,800
The third technique is to use undo.

51
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,240
If you're paying attention when you type,

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,430
you should be able to see pretty quickly when you type something wrong.

53
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,400
Try undoing the last few keystrokes to see if any of those fixed the error.

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,385
As we showed you before, you can hit Cmd+Z to undo a change or

55
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:15,470
Cmd+Shift+Z to redo a change.

56
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,965
On Windows, it's Ctrl+Z to undo and Ctrl+Shift+Z to redo.

57
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:25,725
Or in the XML visualizer, we have these nice handy buttons for undo and redo.

58
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:29,477
If you really don't know what to do, you can always hit this Reset Code button,

59
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:32,127
which brings you back to the original code that we gave you,

60
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:33,867
which should work.

61
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:37,167
The fourth technique is to just ask for help.

62
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:40,527
You can reach out to other students on the peer chat in the lesson or

63
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:42,242
on the forums.

64
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:44,697
Oftentimes, just talking to another person will

65
00:03:44,697 --> 00:03:46,817
help you work out your errors.

66
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:48,097
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

67
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:51,559
There's a lot of really nice Android developers out in the community who

68
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,880
are willing to help you.

69
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,200
In fact, being able to ask for help is an important skill for developers.

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,550
There are no bad questions.

71
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,070
The more you practice the better you'll be at knowing who to ask and

72
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,290
what to ask them in order to help you get to your answer faster.

73
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,800
You can also take a screenshot of the work that you're doing, whether it's

74
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,660
on the phone or in the XML Visualizer, and share that along with the code

75
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,780
on the forums or in chat so that people know the context in which you're asking.

76
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,580
Check out the instructor notes for more details.

77
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,260
Okay, so here's a chance for you to practice some of those techniques.

78
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,540
I have some code here that has errors.

79
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,640
If you click on the link below, it will bring you to the XML Visualizer

80
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,240
with this code already populated in there.

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,010
There's a bunch of error messages, so I want you to try to read them and

82
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,790
try to resolve the errors.

83
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,870
Then come back and describe at least two problems that you saw.

84
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:45,875
For extra credit, tell me if you discovered all four problems.
